Flask uploading with SQLite Database

This is simple flask app written by me few days ago. It supports drag and drop upload client side which uses Blueimp file upload library.
Backend SQLite database is used to store files info. 

Few routes are used to show bandwidth use , total disk storage of files. You can use this repo in commercial and own projects.
